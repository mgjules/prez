# What is a Personalized Development Environment?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- A term coined by [TJ Devries](https://www.youtube.com/c/tjdevries) (core maintainer of Neovim) back @ FOSDEM 2022.
- Customizing your Development Environment to your very own need.

# What is a Development Environment?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- For me, not just your editor.
- Your whole office space!

# Bird's eye view

[ Text Editor ] -- [ PDE ] -- [ Code Editor ] -- [ IDE ]

# Why?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Speed?
- FUN! (For tinkerers)
- Anything you love doing, you will master it with time and become more proficient at it.

## PDE

# When?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Reflect on your current DE?
  - Do you feel sluggish with your current DE?
  - Is there something that bothers you?
  - **Now** is the time to change it!
