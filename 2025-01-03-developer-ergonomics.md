- Software engineer @ Livestorm
- Been in the game for about 16 years now
- I Love Go
- Neovim enthusiast
- I use Arch btw

What is Developer Ergonomics?
---

<!-- pause -->

- Science of designing workspaces and tools for developer comfort and efficiency
- Reducing physical and mental strain through personalized optimizations
- Making technology adapt to humans, not humans to technology

<!-- end_slide -->

Why Developer Ergonomics Matters
---

<!-- pause -->

- Prevents physical injuries and RSI that affect 30% of developers (BLS, 2020)
- Enhances productivity and reduces mental fatigue by eliminating workflow friction
- Extends career longevity by creating a healthier relationship with technology

<!-- end_slide -->

My Physical Setup Journey
---

<!-- pause -->

- Fixed posture issues with Cornell guidelines and strategic monitor placement
- Prevented wrist problems with ergonomic keyboards and regular movement breaks
- Reduced eye strain through natural lighting and workstation optimization

<!-- end_slide -->

How I Transformed My Workflow
---

<!-- pause -->

- Reduced context switching by organizing my digital workspace like a chef's mise en place
- Freed my hands with keyboard mastery and automated repetitive tasks
- Created consistent environments with instant access to tools across all machines

<!-- end_slide -->

The Flow State
---

<!-- pause -->

- Mental state of complete immersion with up to 500% productivity increase (McKinsey, 2013)
- Takes ~23 minutes to enter after interruption and is easily disrupted (UC Irvine, 2005)
- Requires minimizing distractions and context switches (HBR, 2020)

> "Frequent experiences of flow state at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development. Similarly, studies have shown that developers who enjoy their work perform better and produce higher-quality products. Interruptions and delays—which relate to the feedback loops dimension—are important factors that hinder a developer's ability to experience flow state. Other factors include maintaining autonomy over work structure, having clear team and project goals, and engaging in stimulating and challenging tasks." — DevEX: What Actually Drives Productivity

Ergonomics & Flow State
---

<!-- pause -->

- Proper ergonomics creates reliable triggers and reduces barriers to entering flow (CHI, 2021)
- Comfortable tools become extensions of thought while reducing mental/physical fatigue
- Well-designed environments minimize flow-breaking friction and context shifts

Ergonomic Tools

> "Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive you can be." - Andrew Hunt & David Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmer ([Source](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/))
