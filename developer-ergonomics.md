- Neovim enthusiast
- I use Arch btw

## What is Developer Ergonomics?

- Science of designing the developer experience for comfort and efficiency
- Focuses on reducing physical and mental strain
- Personal adaptations to optimize your workflow
- Customizing tools and environment to fit your unique needs
- The intersection of human factors and software development
- Making technology adapt to humans, not humans to technology

## Why Developer Ergonomics Matters

- Prevents physical injuries that sideline careers (NIOSH, 2019)
- RSI affects up to 30% of developers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020)
- Reduces mental fatigue through optimized workflows (Microsoft Research, 2021)
- Enhances productivity by eliminating friction points (DeMarco & Lister, "Peopleware", 2013)
- Shortens recovery time between deep work sessions (Cal Newport, "Deep Work", 2016)
- Creates a healthier relationship with technology (ACM Digital Health Study, 2022)
- Focuses on career longevity rather than short-term output (Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2023)

## Before & After: My Productivity Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time to enter flow state | 25-30 min | 5-10 min | 70% faster |
| Hours in flow per day | 1-2 hours | 3-4 hours | 100% increase |
| Context switches per hour | 8-10 | 3-4 | 60% reduction |
| RSI symptoms | Weekly | Almost never | 90% reduction |
| End-of-day mental fatigue | High (7/10) | Low (3/10) | 60% reduction |
| Time spent debugging env issues | 5-6 hrs/week | <1 hr/week | 80% reduction |

## My Physical Setup Journey

- Started with terrible posture, now follow Cornell guidelines
- Discovered the "right height" monitor setup makes a huge difference
- Switched to ergonomic keyboard after wrist pain warning signs
- Learned to take movement breaks every 30 minutes (saved my back!)
- Found that natural lighting dramatically reduces eye strain

---

## How I Transformed My Workflow

- Cut my context switching in half with better tool integration
- Organized my digital workspace like a chef's mise en place
- Freed my hands from mouse dependence through keyboard mastery
- Automated the boring stuff (because life's too short!)
- Set up instant access to docs and references I need daily
- Created the same comfortable environment on all my machines

## The Flow State

- Mental state of complete immersion and focus (Csikszentmihalyi, "Flow", 1990)
- Takes ~23 minutes to enter after interruption (Mark et al., UC Irvine, 2005)
- Up to 500% productivity increase (McKinsey study, 2013)
- Requires minimizing distractions (Harvard Business Review, "Productivity in the Age of Distraction", 2020)
- Cognitive momentum is easily disrupted (American Psychological Association, 2019)
- Context switching is the enemy of flow (Journal of Experimental Psychology, 2018)

> "Frequent experiences of flow state at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development. Similarly, studies have shown that developers who enjoy their work perform better and produce higher-quality products. Interruptions and delays—which relate to the feedback loops dimension—are important factors that hinder a developer's ability to experience flow state. Other factors include maintaining autonomy over work structure, having clear team and project goals, and engaging in stimulating and challenging tasks." — DevEX: What Actually Drives Productivity

## Ergonomics & Flow State

- Proper ergonomics reduces barriers to entering flow (ACM CHI Conference, 2021)
- Reduces mental/physical fatigue that disrupts flow (Ergonomics Journal, 2019)
- Creates reliable triggers for entering flow state (James Clear, "Atomic Habits", 2018)
- Familiar, comfortable tools become extensions of thought (Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things", 2013)
- Well-designed environment minimizes flow-breaking friction (Nielsen Norman Group, 2020)
- Protects against unnecessary context shifts (Microsoft Productivity Research, 2022)
