- Been in the game for about 16 years now
- I Love Go
- Neovim enthusiast
- I use Arch btw

## What is Developer Ergonomics?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Science of designing the developer experience for comfort and efficiency
- Focuses on reducing physical and mental strain
- Personal adaptations to optimize your workflow
- Customizing tools and environment to fit your unique needs
- The intersection of human factors and software development
- Making technology adapt to humans, not humans to technology

> "Developer ergonomics is about removing friction between your intent and your tools." - Dominic Elm

> "The best tools feel like extensions of ourselves, not obstacles to overcome." - Kent C. Dodds

## Why Developer Ergonomics Matters

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Prevents physical injuries that sideline careers (NIOSH, 2019)
- RSI affects up to 30% of developers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020)
- Reduces mental fatigue through optimized workflows
- Enhances productivity by eliminating friction points
- Shortens recovery time between deep work sessions
- Creates a healthier relationship with technology
- Focuses on career longevity rather than short-term output

## My Physical Setup Journey

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Started with terrible posture, now follow Cornell guidelines
- Discovered the "right height" monitor setup makes a huge difference
- Switched to ergonomic keyboard after wrist pain warning signs
- Learned to take movement breaks every 30 minutes (saved my back!)
- Found that natural lighting dramatically reduces eye strain

## How I Transformed My Workflow

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Cut my context switching in half with better tool integration
- Organized my digital workspace like a chef's mise en place
- Freed my hands from mouse dependence through keyboard mastery
- Automated the boring stuff (because life's too short!)
- Set up instant access to docs and references I need daily
- Created the same comfortable environment on all my machines

---

## The Flow State

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Mental state of complete immersion and focus (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)
- Takes ~23 minutes to enter after interruption (Mark et al., UC Irvine, 2005)
- Up to 500% productivity increase (McKinsey study, 2013)
- Requires minimizing distractions
- Cognitive momentum is easily disrupted
- Context switching is the enemy of flow

---

## Ergonomics & Flow State

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Proper ergonomics reduces barriers to entering flow
- Reduces mental/physical fatigue that disrupts flow
- Creates reliable triggers for entering flow state
- Familiar, comfortable tools become extensions of thought
- Well-designed environment minimizes flow-breaking friction
- Protects against unnecessary context shifts

---

## My Toolkit

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Kitty - GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
- Neovim - Modal editing for reduced hand movement
- Lazygit - TUI for streamlined git operations
- Rectangle - Tiling window manager for macOS
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet - AI model for programming assistance
- Claude Code - AI pair programmer in the terminal

---

## Terminal-Centric Workflow

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Reduced mouse dependence
- Custom keybindings for common actions
- Text interfaces often require less cognitive load
- Consistent experience across systems
- Terminal applications often use fewer resources

## Start Your Own Journey Today

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Those keyboard shortcuts you keep avoiding? Learn 3 new ones this week
- Your future self will thank you for setting up a dotfiles repo now
- That chair you sit in 8+ hours a day? It's worth the investment!
- Try the Pomodoro technique - it changed how I work
- Master one tool that sparks joy rather than dabbling in ten

---

## My Multi-OS Adventure

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- I've stopped fighting OS wars - ergonomics transcends platforms
- Found ways around macOS, Linux and Windows quirks with the right tools
- Now I feel at home whether on my work Mac or personal Arch setup
- Your muscle memory and workflow patterns can travel with you
- I can recreate my experience anywhere with a few config files

## My Most Important Lesson

<!-- pause -->

> "I realized ergonomics isn't about coding faster; it's about coding for decades to come."
