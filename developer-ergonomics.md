## What is Developer Ergonomics?

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Science of designing the developer experience for comfort and efficiency
- Focuses on reducing physical and mental strain
- Creates sustainable, enjoyable development practices

> "Developer ergonomics is about removing friction between your intent and your tools." - Dominic Elm

> "The best tools feel like extensions of ourselves, not obstacles to overcome." - Kent C. Dodds

## Why Developer Ergonomics Matters

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Prevents burnout and repetitive strain injuries (NIOSH, 2019)
- Improves long-term career sustainability
- Prioritizes wellbeing over raw output
- Decreases recovery time after intense work sessions
- RSI affects up to 30% of developers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020)
- Promotes a healthier relationship with technology

---

## Physical Ergonomics

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Proper seating and desk setup (Cornell Ergonomics Lab)
- Monitor position and height (OSHA guidelines)
- Keyboard and mouse selection
- Regular movement and stretching (Hedge et al., 2018)
- Lighting and environment (International Commission on Illumination)

---

## Workflow Ergonomics

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Minimize unnecessary interactions
- Thoughtful tool organization
- Keyboard-centric workflows
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Streamlined information access
- Consistent environment across machines

---

## The Flow State

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Mental state of complete immersion and focus (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)
- Takes ~23 minutes to enter after interruption (Mark et al., UC Irvine, 2005)
- Up to 500% productivity increase (McKinsey study, 2013)
- Requires minimizing distractions
- Cognitive momentum is easily disrupted
- Context switching is the enemy of flow

---

## Ergonomics & Flow State

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Proper ergonomics reduces barriers to entering flow
- Reduces mental/physical fatigue that disrupts flow
- Creates reliable triggers for entering flow state
- Familiar, comfortable tools become extensions of thought
- Well-designed environment minimizes flow-breaking friction
- Protects against unnecessary context shifts

## My Toolkit

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Kitty - GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
- Neovim - Modal editing for reduced hand movement
- Lazygit - TUI for streamlined git operations
- Rectangle - Tiling window manager for macOS
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet - AI model for programming assistance
- Claude Code - AI pair programmer in the terminal

---

## Terminal-Centric Workflow

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Reduced mouse dependence
- Custom keybindings for common actions
- Text interfaces often require less cognitive load
- Consistent experience across systems
- Terminal applications often use fewer resources

## Quick Wins

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Learn basic keyboard shortcuts
- Set up dotfiles repository
- Invest in a comfortable chair and keyboard
- Schedule regular breaks (Pomodoro technique)
- Learn one tool deeply rather than many superficially

---

## Cross-Platform Approach

<!-- pause -->

<!-- incremental_lists: true -->

- Operating systems don't matter for developer ergonomics
- Tools can compensate for OS limitations and quirks
- Focus on consistent experience across environments
- Your ergonomic setup should work regardless of platform
- Same tools and workflows can often be recreated anywhere
