# **Stand out from the crowd**

Tips to improve your CV

<!--
- Present myself
- Disclaimer
  - Not an exact science because of the human factor (imperfections in the system we built).
  - Not an expert. Based on personal experience. 
- Straight to the point. Not a time to bore you. Try my best to facilitate discussion (ask question).
- Show of hand: Students, Devs, others.

<!--
- Since some time now companies are doing layoffs and the pool of unemployed devs has become quite large.
- Many of them with the stamps of their previous employement on their CV.
- Thus the importance of standing out of that crowd.

## Curriculum Vitae

<div v-click>Indirect presentation</div>
<div v-click>1-3 pages</div>
<div v-click>Scanned by recruiters on average in ~6-7s</div>

<!-- <a v-click href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">Example</a> -->

<!--
This part is just to bring everybody up to speed aka find some common ground.

## Tips

In no logical order.

<!--
While those tips work great for local companies, they are geared towards the global market (that's where most of my testing has been done).
-->

---

### Tip #0

Optimise for humans first.

<!--
Always remember it will be read by humans. Specially speedreaders.
- Proper font styles and text heirarchy.
- Great constrast ratio. (No fancy background and colors)
- Sensible spacing and indentation.
- Be consistent.

Overall, keep the design simple!
-->

---

### Tip #1

Prioritise the sections.

<!--
Most modern languages read from left to right and top to bottom. Priority should follow that order. (incl. sub-sections)

Example of an order: Personal Information, Experiences, Projects, Contributions, Awards, Certifications, Educations and Interests.
-->

---

### Tip #2

Stay away from ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ !

<!--
Star rating skills/talents aka infographics might be tempting but in fact it is very confusing and opened to too many interpretations.

Ideally lose the skill section. Add the skills under the relevant jobs and/or projects.
-->

---

### Tip #3

Keep the summary short, sweet, factual and simple.

<!--
No need to repeat ourselves in the "Personal Information" section. No need to go into much details: that's the purpose of the other sections.

Use it to set the tone.
-->

---

### Tip #4

Have an **active** LinkedIn profile.

<!--
Not every information will fit into our CV.

Also networking on LinkedIn can reap some unexpected benefits.
-->

---

### Tip #5

Show impact! 💪

<!--
Every contribution we make should have a positive impact on the company. Afterall that's what we are employed for.
The customers do not care about the programming languages, libraries, frameworks or architectures we use.

The description under each job in the "Experiences" section is a great place to highlight those with **numbers** and **percentages**.

Use bullet points and action words (built, developed, created)!
-->

---

### Tip #6

No need for personal photo.

<!--
Some companies pride themselves in being inclusive (m/f/d) and might be turned off with applications that include a personal photo.

While this rule varies from company to company and country to country, it is safest to leave the personal photo out.
-->

---

### Tip #7

Attention to details.

<!--
Proof-read, proof-read, proof-read, proof-read, proof-read!
-->

---

### Tip #8

Do not be scared of career breaks! 🏕️

<!--
We are humans and career breaks are natural. Mention them along with how they helped.
-->

---

### Tip #9

Do not lie!

<!--
"Fake it until you make it" will backfire for sure during the interview process. Seasoned interviewers see through that easily.

Be authentic!
-->

---

### Tip #10

Tailor it.

<!--
Stay away from general purpose CV. Tailor it to match the industry or sub-field you are in.
-->

---

### Tip #11

Self-market yourself!

<!--
Sometimes we are too humble and do not put ourselves in the best light.

Understanding our strengths and weaknesses will help in putting our best self foward without coming out as arrogant but confident.

What are you bringing to the table? Why you and not the other X applicants?
