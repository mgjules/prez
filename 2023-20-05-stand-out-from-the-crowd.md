  - Not an exact science because of the human factor (imperfections in the system we built).
  - Not an expert. Based on personal experience.
- Straight to the point. Not a time to bore you. Try my best to facilitate discussion (ask question).

## Tech Dilemma

<!--
What is that tech dilemma?
-->

---

url: <https://layoffs.fyi>

---

<!--
- Since some time now companies are doing layoffs and the pool of unemployed devs has become quite large.
- Let's not even mention those that are currently working and looking for new opportunities.
- Many of them with the stamps of their previous employement on their CV.
- Thus the importance of standing out of that crowd.
-->

## Curriculum Vitae

<div v-click>Indirect presentation</div>
<div v-click>1-3 pages</div>
<div v-click>Scanned by recruiters on average in ~6-7s</div>

<!-- <a v-click href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">Example</a> -->

<!--
This part is just to bring everybody up to speed aka find some common ground.

### Tips

In no logical order.

<!--
While those tips work great for local companies, they are geared towards the global market (that's where most of my testing has been done).
-->

---

#### Tip #0

Optimise for humans first.

<!--
Always remember it will be read by humans. Specially speedreaders.
- Proper font styles and text heirarchy.
- Great constrast ratio. (No fancy background and colors)
- Sensible spacing and indentation.
- Be consistent.

Overall, keep the design simple!
-->

---

#### Tip #1

Prioritise the sections.

<!--
Most modern languages read from left to right and top to bottom. Priority should follow that order. (incl. sub-sections)

Example of an order: Personal Information, Experiences, Projects, Contributions, Awards, Certifications, Educations and Interests.
-->

---

#### Tip #2

Stay away from ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ !

<!--
Star rating skills/talents aka infographics might be tempting but in fact it is very confusing and opened to too many interpretations.

Ideally lose the skill section. Add the skills under the relevant jobs and/or projects.
-->

---

#### Tip #3

Keep the summary short, sweet, factual and simple.

<!--
No need to repeat ourselves in the "Personal Information" section. No need to go into much details: that's the purpose of the other sections.

Use it to set the tone.
-->

---

#### Tip #4

Have an **active** LinkedIn profile.

<!--
Not every information will fit into our CV.

Also networking on LinkedIn can reap some unexpected benefits.
-->

---

#### Tip #5

Show impact! üí™

<!--
Every contribution we make should have a positive impact on the company. Afterall that's what we are employed for.
The customers do not care about the programming languages, libraries, frameworks or architectures we use.

The description under each job in the "Experiences" section is a great place to highlight those with **numbers** and **percentages**.

Use bullet points and action words (built, developed, created)!
-->

---

#### Tip #6

No need for personal photo.

<!--
Some companies pride themselves in being inclusive (m/f/d) and might be turned off with applications that include a personal photo.

While this rule varies from company to company and country to country, it is safest to leave the personal photo out.
-->

---

#### Tip #7

Attention to details.

<!--
Proof-read, proof-read, proof-read, proof-read, proof-read!
-->

---

#### Tip #8

Do not be scared of career breaks! üèïÔ∏è

<!--
We are humans and career breaks are natural. Mention them along with how they helped.
-->

---

#### Tip #9

Do not lie!

<!--
"Fake it until you make it" will backfire for sure during the interview process. Seasoned interviewers see through that easily.

Be authentic!
-->

---

#### Tip #10

Tailor it.

<!--
Stay away from general purpose CV. Tailor it to match the industry or sub-field you are in.
-->

---

#### Tip #11

Self-market yourself!

![why you?](assets/meme-why-you.jpg)

<!--
Sometimes we are too humble and do not put ourselves in the best light.

Understanding our strengths and weaknesses will help in putting our best self foward without coming out as arrogant but confident.

What are you bringing to the table? Why you and not the other X applicants?
-->

## Motivational letter

<div v-click>Why you are the perfect candidate for a certain position</div>
<div v-click>1 page</div>
<div v-click>Not to be confused with cover letter but apparently few people care</div>

---

### Tips

In no logical order. (you know the drill)

---

### Tip #0

Do not skip it!

<!--
On most online application forms, it is optional but in reality, it is very much required.

If you want to stand out, it gives you the perfect opportunity.

It will allow you to fill in the gaps in your curriculum vitae since there is not enough space there to share all your amazing skills and qualifications.
-->

---

### Tip #1

Greet a person and not to whom it may concern.

<!--
Show that you've done your research and homework about the company.

Make it feel deliberately targeted.
-->

---

### Tip #2

Don't underestimate the opening.

<!--
Same as reading a story, spike the reader's interest with a strong opening.

Stay away from generic opening like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm writing to express my interest in the position of‚Ä¶‚Äù..

Be more creative!
-->

---

### Tip #3

DRY!

<!--
As you are filling in the gaps in your curriculum vitae,
don't repeat yourself but expand qualifications and why you are a good match for the position.
-->

---

### Tip #4

Hehe, I know this and that!

<!--
Transitioning from the previous tip, as you are expanding on your qualifications,
point out your key skills that reassure the interviewer that there is no better fit than you.

In essence, you are helping the interviewer connect the dots.
-->

---

### Tip #5

Tailor!

<img src="/assets/tailor-wick.jpg" alt="Tailor Mr Wick" width="500" />

<!--
Don't wanna repeat myself but I want to get this through.

Show that you care about the position and didn't just throw a dynamite in the lake hoping to catch something.
-->

---

### Tip #6

<i_use_arch_btw_1252@windows.sucks>

<!--
If you are applying through email, then use a proper email address from a respectable mail server.
-->

---

## Bonus: Interview

<div v-click>Screening > Technical > Team > Cultural > Boss > HR</div>
<div v-click>30-60mins</div>
<div v-click>How much of each do want? YES</div>

---

### Tips

In no logical order. (yeah yeah we know)

---

#### Tip #0

Know your tooling.

<!--
Navigating around your tooling efficiently is impressive.
-->

---

#### Tip #1

Get ready to note down.

<!--
You might be given a question or case study to analyze. Noting down key information or drawing can better help visualize.
-->

---

#### Tip #2

Make yourself comfortable.

<!--
You don't want to request a bathroom break in the middle of the interview even in case of force majeur.

Silo out any distraction.
-->

---

#### Tip #3

You are also the interviewer.

<!--
Use the opportunity to know if the company fits your requirements.

Spot any red flag through questions you are asked.
-->

---

#### Tip #4

Ask questions.

<!--
They expect you to ask questions to show your interest and extent of your research.

Ask questions to get a better understanding of the technical challenge.

Do not ask tricky questions or questions that can easily be answered with a Google search.
-->

---

#### Tip #5

Take some deep breaths before.

<!--
Keep cool and calm down. Picture it as any other meeting or exchange.
-->

---

#### Tip #6

Know your story well.

<!--
Nobody knows you better than yourself and stumbling when relating it can come off as you're making things up.
-->

---

#### Tip #7

Listen.

<img src="/assets/objection.gif" alt="Objection" width="300" />

<!--
Don't jump to conclusions and wait to get the full picture and understanding before answering.

Also nobody likes being cut off.

Use that moment to formulate your answer/question as you are gradually given more information.
-->

---

#### Tip #8

Show that you can work in a team.

<!--
Most companies value team players above technical excellency.

10x engineers only create 10x more work for the whole team.

Be the person who you want to work with at the end of the day.
